**A Telegram → Claude Code channel plugin.** It turns an ordinary, live Claude Code session into a Telegram agent: the bot listens to one or more chats, replies inside the same session, and keeps all the work within your regular Anthropic Max subscription — with no separate SDK billing.

It replaces the deprecated `claude -p` gateway pattern (a Python daemon that spawned a fresh headless session for every message). Cutover deadline — **2026-06-15** (Anthropic is splitting billing; details in section [13](#13-why-migrate--the-2026-06-15-deadline)).

> **Migrating from the old gateway? There is now a doctor — use it.** The read-only [`doctor-dashi-plugin`](skills/doctor-dashi-plugin/SKILL.md) skill diagnoses the whole cutover — workspace placement, hooks (profile-aware), the permission gate and its policy, multichat invariants, webhook bind + token-file hygiene, MCP comms config, allowlist, fleet isolation, and live-session health — and encodes every mistake we already paid for so you don't repeat them. Run it during EVERY migration and whenever the bridge misbehaves: `bun skills/doctor-dashi-plugin/scripts/doctor.ts` (on a systemd host it autodetects the rest).
>
> **And one hard rule: migrate from a Claude Code terminal session, not through Telegram.** The migration changes the very bridge that carries your Telegram messages — if it breaks mid-change, the agent you were instructing through Telegram goes silent and can no longer fix itself. Work in a terminal (`tmux attach`, or a plain `claude` session on the host); let Telegram be the thing you test, not the thing you work through.

![Architecture — Telegram ↔ plugin ↔ Claude Code session](docs/assets/architecture-hero.svg)

One plugin process = one Telegram bot = one agent. By default it serves **a single DM chat** (legacy single-session mode). With `multichat.enabled` turned on, the same bot fans incoming messages out across several per-chat tmux sessions of one identity — see section [3](#3-multichat--how-it-works-and-why).

> **Status:** in production across a multi-agent fleet. Current release — **[v1.2.0](CHANGELOG.md)** (2026-07-10): model-aware context HUD, task pin reality mirror, output formatting polish — see section [15](#15-whats-new). Versioning and release process: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) · [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md). CI: `bun test` + `bun run typecheck` must pass clean before merge.

## 1. How the plugin works and why you need it

### Why

The old architecture (`jarvis-telegram-gateway`) is a Python daemon that ran `claude -p` (a headless Agent SDK session) for every Telegram message. Each turn = a new process, a fresh context load, and — after June 15, 2026 — **a separate SDK credit billed outside your Max subscription** (see section 13).

This plugin keeps **one live, interactive Claude Code session** and simply pushes channel messages into it. The session is classified as interactive → usage stays within your normal Max quota and does not grow with the number of Telegram messages. As a bonus, the session remembers context between messages instead of starting from scratch every time.

### How

It is a Claude Code **channel plugin** (Bun + TypeScript, grammY for Telegram, Zod for validation). The message flow:

1. `TelegramPoller` (`src/telegram/poller.ts`) pulls `getUpdates` (long polling) with a per-instance lock on `state_dir`, so two processes can't bring up the same bot.
2. Each incoming message passes the **allowlist gate** (`src/telegram/gate.ts`) — anyone not allowed is rejected *before* any processing.
3. Handlers (`src/telegram/handlers.ts`) assemble text + media into a channel message (`src/prompt/build.ts`) and push it into the Claude Code session.
4. Claude thinks, calls tools/MCP, and forms a reply.
5. The reply goes out to Telegram through `safe-telegram-api` (`src/safety/safe-telegram-api.ts`): secret redaction → HTML validation → 4000-char chunking → token-bucket rate limiter.

In parallel, three "progress surfaces" run (fed by hooks, see section 4):

| Subsystem | What it does |
|---|---|
| `StatusManager` | transient bubble: typing → thinking → name of the current tool |
| `ProgressReporter` | a separate rolling message with activity lines (PreToolUse/PostToolUse/Stop) via `editMessageText` |
| `TaskMirror` | a third rolling message — milestones from `TodoWrite` / `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` |

Two ways to launch: a standalone Bun process (`bun start`, a quick token check) or production via `claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:dashi-channel` (Claude Code itself hosts the plugin runtime). See section 12.

---

## 2. Personal session + channel tmux, and how to add your user_id

### Process model

In legacy mode the plugin lives inside a single Claude Code session, which is convenient to run inside a named **tmux session** (e.g. `channel-thrall`) — that way you can keep it permanently resident, reconnect over SSH without losing state, and mirror the pane to Telegram (section 6). One workspace, one `CLAUDE.md`, one bot, one DM chat.

### How to add your user_id (legacy single-DM)

Access is the single gate, and it is **mandatory**. Allowed users are set via the `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` variable:

```bash
# in channel.env (CSV, no spaces after commas, positive integers only)
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS=123456789,987654321
```

The `config.json` equivalent:

```json
{ "allowed_user_ids": [123456789, 987654321] }
```

The parser (`src/config.ts`) validates every value as a positive integer and fails with a clear error on garbage. Env overrides `config.json`. In a DM, Telegram sets `chat.id == user.id`, so the gate checks both sender_id and chat_id (defence-in-depth, `src/telegram/gate.ts`).

**How to find your user_id:** message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) — it replies with your numeric id. For groups the id starts with `-100…`.

> Anti-spoof: a reply-to message is validated as belonging to your bot (`is_bot` + username), so forged reply metadata can't bypass the gate (`src/telegram/addressing.ts`). See section 10.

---

## 3. Multichat — how it works and why

![Multichat — one bot fans out across several per-chat tmux sessions](docs/assets/multichat.svg)

### Why

Sometimes you need to run several chats in parallel under the same identity: the operator's personal DM + a work group + a sandbox. One bot, one personality, different "rooms" with different rights and different privacy levels.

### How

`MultichatRouter` (`src/router/multichat-router.ts`, default **OFF**) routes incoming messages across several **per-chat tmux sessions** of `claude` via `TmuxSessionPool`. The plugin ↔ session link is a JSON pipe over a file-based inbox/outbox (`inbox-bridge.ts`). Hybrid routing (PR #33): the operator's DM goes to the host session (`channel-thrall`), groups go to their own per-chat sessions. The per-chat session's Stop hook writes the final reply to the outbox (PR #34), from which the plugin picks it up and sends it to Telegram.

Enable it with a flag in `config.json` (or `TELEGRAM_MULTICHAT_ENABLED=1`):

```json
{
  "multichat": {
    "enabled": true,
    "workspace_dir": "/home/you/.claude-lab/myagent/.claude",
    "policy_path": "/home/you/.claude-lab/myagent/.claude/chats/policy.yaml",
    "state_dir": "/home/you/.claude-lab/myagent/.claude/state/multichat"
  }
}
```

Chats are described in `policy.yaml` (strict Zod schema, `src/chats/policy-loader.ts` — a typo in a key fails the load loudly, not silently):

```yaml
version: 1
allowlist:
  chats: ["123456789", "-1001234567890"]   # chat_id as a string; negative group ids MUST be quoted
  users: ["123456789"]                       # who is allowed to write at all
mention_allowlist: ["123456789"]             # who may summon the bot via @mention in groups
chats:
  "123456789":
    mode: private                            # private | public — selects the available surfaces
    streaming: progress                      # progress | off
    tmux_mirror: true                        # TmuxMirror only in this chat
    edit_message_progress: true              # rolling editMessageText for ProgressReporter
    delivery: streamed                       # streamed | final_only
    persona_file: chats/personas/warchief.md # per-chat persona overlay (relative to workspace_dir)
    handoff_file: core/hot/handoff.md
    system_reminder: "This is the operator's personal DM. Full access."
    idle_ttl_ms: 1800000                     # 30 min before the tmux session is unloaded (default)
    max_queue_depth: 1                        # how many inbound messages may be queued (default 1)
  "-1001234567890":
    mode: public
    streaming: off
    tmux_mirror: false
    edit_message_progress: false
    delivery: final_only
    persona_file: chats/personas/intensive-agent-os.md
    system_reminder: "Public group. No internal logs or mirrors."
```

The per-chat persona overlay is applied by the SessionStart hook `chats/hooks/session-start.sh`: it reads the chat's persona file (resolved relative to `multichat.workspace_dir`) inside the tmux session and injects it on top of the single identity via `additionalContext` — no separate `CLAUDE.md` per chat is needed. Logs: `{state_dir}/chats/<chat_id>/{inbox,outbox,processing,dead-letter}/*.json`.

**Failure mode:** an invalid `policy.yaml` → the plugin logs the error and degrades to multichat-OFF (legacy single-DM). Better to work with one chat than to crash entirely.

**Privacy isolation:** `private` chats get all surfaces (TmuxMirror, progress-edit). `public` chats get only the final reply (`delivery: final_only`), no internal logs or mirrors. See section 10.

---

## 4. Plugin hooks

Progress in Telegram (`ProgressReporter`, `TaskMirror`, `StatusManager`) is fed by Claude Code hooks. Without installing the hooks these surfaces stay silent — you only get the final reply.

![Hooks — Claude Code event flows through post-hook and the webhook server to the progress surfaces](docs/assets/hooks.svg)

### Installation

```bash
bash plugin/scripts/install-hooks.sh \
  --settings ~/.claude/settings.json \
  --chat-id <your-Telegram-chat-id> \
  --webhook-url http://127.0.0.1:8089/hooks/agent \
  --agent-id dashi-channel
```

Idempotent: marker-based replacement (`"dashi-channel-hook"`) — re-running doesn't duplicate entries and cleans up legacy markerless ones. The script installs **five** events: `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop` (for Pre/PostToolUse the matcher is `.*`, i.e. all tool calls).

### How it works

1. On every event, Claude Code runs `scripts/post-hook.ts` (reads the hook JSON from stdin).
2. `post-hook.ts` POSTs the payload to `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL` with an `Authorization: Bearer $TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` header. **Stdout is always empty, exit is always 0** — the hook never blocks Claude and injects nothing into the model's context.
3. The plugin's webhook server (`src/webhook/server.ts`, `POST /hooks/agent`) verifies the bearer token (timing-safe), caps the body at 256 KB, checks the chatId allowlist, and runs Zod validation.
4. `src/hooks/claude-events.ts` maps the payload into internal events and routes them to three independent, best-effort surfaces: MemoryWriter, StatusManager/ProgressReporter, TaskMirror.

Event mapping:

| Hook event | Activity | TaskMirror |
|---|---|---|
| `PreToolUse` | `tool_start` | `task_create` (if TaskCreate) |
| `PostToolUse` | `tool_end` | `task_create` / `task_update` / `todo_write` |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `reasoning` | — |
| `Stop` | `session_stop` | `todo_session_stop` |
| `SessionStart` | `session_start` | — |

> The bearer token is **never written to settings.json** — it's read from the `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` env var at the moment the hook runs. Webhook bind — `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_HOST` / `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_PORT` (default loopback). More in [`docs/progress-reporter-setup.md`](plugin/docs/progress-reporter-setup.md).

---

## 5. Interactive commands and channel control: permission prompts, AskUserQuestion, OOB slash commands

When Claude hits an interactive prompt inside the session, the plugin surfaces it in Telegram and feeds the answer back — the operator drives the agent from the chat, no SSH needed.

### Permission relay (sudo and other sensitive tools)

`src/channel/permissions.ts` listens for `notifications/claude/channel/permission_request`. The flow:

1. Claude wants to run a sensitive tool (e.g. `sudo …`) → sends a request with `tool_name`, `description`, `input_preview`.
2. The plugin puts the request into `pending` (keyed by a 5-letter short-id) and sends a Telegram message with an inline keyboard `[See more] [✅ Allow] [❌ Deny]`.
3. The operator taps a button (or replies with the text `yes abcde` / `no abcde`). The responder is checked against `permission_relay.allowed_user_ids`.
4. The verdict goes back into the session via `notifications/claude/channel/permission` → Claude allows or blocks the tool.

Every decision is written to an audit JSONL (`statePaths.logs.permissions`). The short-id alphabet excludes the letter `l` (to avoid confusion with `1`/`i`).

### AskUserQuestion relay (PR #28)

The `AskUserQuestion` tool renders in Telegram as an inline keyboard (`src/channel/ask-user-question.ts` + `src/telegram/ask-user-question.ts`):

- A hook wrapper POSTs the question to `POST /hooks/ask-user-question/request` and waits for the answer.
- One question = one message with buttons. Callbacks: `ask:choose` (single), `ask:toggle` + `ask:done` (multi-select), `ask:other` (free text).
- The answer arrives at `POST /hooks/ask-user-question/answer`, bound by `chat_id` (protection against cross-chat injection) and by the responder allowlist.
- Timeout (default 5 min) → the relay returns `{ status: 'timeout' }`, and the hook falls back to the native CC UI.

Both `/hooks/ask-user-question/*` endpoints accept **loopback only** (127.0.0.1 / localhost / ::1) + a bearer token — so the question and the token never leak to an external host.

### Channel control commands (OOB slash commands)

These are "out-of-band" commands for driving the plugin and the live session from Telegram. The plugin intercepts them *before* they reach Claude as a normal prompt — so `/status` never wakes the model, and the keystroke commands (`/keys`, `/cc`, `/stop`, `/reset`, `/new`) drive the agent's tmux pane directly. They're registered via `setMyCommands`, so they appear in Telegram's "/" menu (descriptions localized to Russian, PR #18).

The full, authoritative list lives in the code: `plugin/src/commands/oob.ts` (`helpText()` + `BOT_COMMANDS` + the `OobCommandName` union) and `plugin/src/commands/keys.ts` (the `/keys` keypad token whitelist and `/cc` passthrough).

| Command | What it does | Usage / when to use |
|---|---|---|
| `/help` | Prints the command list. Replies in Telegram, does **not** wake Claude. | `/help` |
| `/status` | Plugin + session snapshot: `bot_id`, `state_dir`, allowed user, poller offset/error, status-manager state, webhook on/off + port. Reply-only, doesn't wake Claude. | `/status` |
| `/stop` | Interrupts Claude's current generation/tool. When a tmux pane is resolvable it presses **Escape** in the pane (a real interrupt) and cancels the "typing…" bubble; otherwise it falls back to relaying a `/stop` signal Claude reads on its next channel turn. | `/stop` — use when the agent is running off in the wrong direction. |
| `/reset force` | Resets the session. With a pane resolvable it types Claude Code's own `/clear` into the session (fresh context); otherwise it relays the reset signal. Bare `/reset` only re-asks for confirmation. | `/reset force` — wipe context and start clean. |
| `/new force` | Starts a "new session". Claude Code has no separate new-session primitive, so this is the same `/clear` action as `/reset force`. Bare `/new` only re-asks. | `/new force` |
| `/mirror on\|off\|status` | Toggles the terminal mirror (section 6) at runtime — no plugin restart. `status` (or bare `/mirror`) prints enabled/off, message_id, last-poll age, last error. | `/mirror on` · `/mirror off` · `/mirror status` |
| `/keys` | Opens a one-tap inline-button keypad of **whitelisted** keystrokes in the agent's tmux pane — the way you **answer a native Claude Code dialog** from Telegram. One tap = one key into the session; the panel isn't consumed (tap repeatedly across a multi-step dialog). Includes `⌫ backspace` and `🧹 clear`. | `/keys`, then tap a button. The easy way to answer a dialog. |
| `/cc <command>` | Passes a command through to **Claude Code's own slash commands** by typing it into the session (`/compact`, `/model`, `/context`, custom skills, …). Narrow charset — no shell metacharacters, can't compose a shell command. | `/cc compact` · `/cc model opus` · `/cc context` |

#### Answering native confirmation dialogs (the main use-case)

When Claude Code hits a native terminal dialog — e.g. a permission rule like

```
Permission rule Bash(rm:*) requires confirmation
  1. Yes
  2. Yes, and don't ask again
  3. No
```

— it blocks in the pane. The **terminal mirror** (section 6) shows that dialog in Telegram, and you answer it without SSH in one of two ways:

- **`/keys`** → tap a button. The panel is one tap per key, laid out as:
  - Row 1: `[1][2][3][4][5]` — dialog option selectors
  - Row 2: `[6][7][8][9][0]`
  - Row 3: `[✓ y][✗ n][⏎ enter][⎋ esc]`
  - Row 4: `[↑ up][↓ down][← left][→ right]`
  - Row 5: `[⇥ tab][␣ space]`

  Tap the same keypad repeatedly across a multi-step dialog — it isn't consumed. Tapping `1` picks option 1, `3` picks "No", `⎋ esc` cancels.

Each tap injects exactly one keystroke from a closed whitelist into the pane — there is no free-text keystroke command, so a pane that dropped into a raw shell still can't be driven to run anything.

**`/keys` keypad keys (the complete whitelist):**

| Group | Tokens |
|---|---|
| Digits | `0` `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6` `7` `8` `9` |
| Yes / No | `y` `n` |
| Confirm / cancel | `enter` · `esc` (alias `escape`) |
| Editing | `tab` · `space` |
| Arrows | `up` · `down` · `left` · `right` |

Anything outside this set is rejected. Because the set is a closed whitelist with no free text, a pane that dropped out of Claude into a raw shell still can't be driven to run a command.

#### Behavior worth knowing

- **`/stop` is best-effort.** With a pane it sends a real Escape; without one it only relays a signal Claude notices on its next channel read — it does not kill the process.
- **`/reset` and `/new` require `force`.** Bare `/reset` / `/new` just return a hint ("add `force` to confirm") — protection against an accidental context wipe.
- **The `@botname` suffix is stripped** — `/status@yourbot` in a group works the same as `/status`.
- In multichat, `/mirror` availability is controlled by the per-chat `tmux_mirror` flag in `policy.yaml`.
- `/keys`, `/cc`, and the pane-driven branches of `/stop`/`/reset`/`/new` need a resolvable tmux pane. Without one (no tmux config / no `$TMUX`) the plugin replies that the pane is unavailable.

> **Security (fail-closed).** Every control command — and every `/keys` button tap — is honored **only** in a **private chat**, from a Telegram **user id on the allow-list** (`allowed_user_ids`), in a chat on the **chat allow-list** (`allowed_chat_ids`). All three must hold (defence-in-depth — see `src/telegram/handlers.ts` and the `kkey:` auth in `src/telegram/keys-panel-ui.ts`). They **never** run in groups, and **never** from a non-allowed user — an outsider can't reset your session or press keys in your terminal. A non-allowed tap gets only a "not authorized" toast and no keystroke is sent.

> Testing: command parsing/routing is covered by `tests/commands/oob.test.ts` and the keypad by `tests/telegram/keys-panel.test.ts`. A live run against a real bot — the operator smoke matrix [`plugin/docs/canary-smoke.md`](plugin/docs/canary-smoke.md).

## 6. Terminal mirror — how it works and why

### Why

The operator wants to see the "raw" terminal output (bash, logs) of what the agent is doing right now — without SSH access to the machine. `TmuxMirror` (PR #15) mirrors the pane of a tmux session into **one rolling Telegram message** via `editMessageText`.

### How

Default **OFF**, opt-in via config (in multichat — via the `tmux_mirror` flag in policy, per chat):

```json
{
  "tmux_mirror": {
    "enabled": true,
    "pane_target": "channel-thrall:0.0",
    "poll_interval_ms": 5000,
    "line_count": 50,
    "mode": "latest_inbound_only",
    "max_lines": 14,
    "hide_segments": ["boot_banner", "inbound_warning", "footer_hints", "input_box"]
  }
}
```

Behavior:

- Polls `tmux capture-pane -p -t <pane_target> -S -<line_count>` every `poll_interval_ms`.
- ANSI/CSI/OSC/DCS sequences are stripped, control chars (except `\n`, `\t`) removed.
- The text passes through `redactSecrets` (section 10) → HTML-escape → wrapped in `<pre>`.
- Hash-based dedup: an identical poll → no API call.
- `mode: latest_inbound_only` (default since PR #21) trims everything up to the last `← <channel>:` preview — you only see what the agent is doing after the operator's last message.
- `max_lines` cap (default 14, range 4..100, 0=off) — the top is trimmed with a `… +N lines` marker.
- An edit `"message to edit not found"` → re-send; other 4xx do **not** trigger a resend (storm protection).
- SIGINT/SIGTERM → best-effort `deleteMessage`.

Runtime control: `/mirror on|off|status` without restarting the plugin.

> The mirror is **for the private DM only** (`mode: private`). In public groups it's turned off, so the internal "kitchen" doesn't leak.

---

## 7. Media, audio, and voice-message transcription

### Photos

After the allowlist gate, `handleInboundPhoto` **auto-downloads** the largest resolution into `{state_dir}/inbox/` (perms `0600`, name from `file_unique_id`, hard cap 20 MB) and injects it into the prompt as:

```
<media kind="photo" local_path="/abs/inbox/123-abc.jpg" width="…" height="…" />
```

The agent reads the file with a normal `Read` on the `local_path`. Albums (several photos at once) are buffered by `media_group_id` with a flush on silence (`album-buffer.ts`); each fragment is atomically written to disk before the in-memory update, with recovery on restart and a dead-letter for broken ones.

### Documents

A document is **not** downloaded immediately — it arrives as metadata:

```
<media kind="document" file_id="…" name="foo.pdf" mime="application/pdf" size="12345" />
```

When the agent needs the bytes, it calls the `download_attachment(file_id, chat_id)` tool → the plugin downloads it into the inbox and returns the absolute path (with the chat_id checked against the allowlist, protection against cross-chat leakage).

### Voice → transcription

`maybeTranscribeVoice` (`src/telegram/media.ts`) transcribes via **Groq Whisper** (an OpenAI-compatible endpoint):

- **What to use:** the `GROQ_API_KEY` variable. The model is `config.voice.model` (a working pick: `whisper-large-v3-turbo`), the language is `config.voice.language` (e.g. `ru`).
- Endpoint: `POST https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions`, `response_format=text`.
- Hard cap 25 MB (Groq's limit), checked against Telegram metadata **before** downloading.
- Telegram serves voice as `.oga` (Ogg/Opus) — Groq rejects that extension, so the file is renamed to `.ogg` before upload.
- The key is redacted from any error messages. Exceptions are not propagated — the descriptor always carries a status.

The result in the prompt:

```
<media kind="voice" mime="audio/ogg" duration_sec="5" transcript="hi operator" transcription_status="ok" />
```

Without `GROQ_API_KEY` → `transcription_status="missing_key"` (no error — Claude decides whether to ask you to enable it).

---

## 8. Session auto-restart — so the link never drops

The link holds at three levels, from the smallest glitch to a process crash:

**1. In-process poller auto-reconnect (PR #30).** On network failures / 5xx / disconnects, `TelegramPoller` reconnects itself with exponential backoff `1s → 2s → 4s → … → cap 60s` + jitter, and the counter resets on the first successful `getUpdates`. On `429` it honors `retry_after`; on `409 Conflict` (another consumer holds the token) it backs off for up to 8 attempts; on `401` up to 3. The process doesn't die in the meantime.

**2. Single-instance lock.** The lock file `{state_dir}/bot.pid` is created atomically (`O_EXCL`). A second process reads the PID, checks `process.kill(pid, 0)`, and refuses to start if the owner is alive — no "409 storm" from two pollers on one bot. A dead PID is cleaned up and the lock is reclaimed (up to 3 attempts).

**3. Process supervisor (restart of the whole process).**

- **Linux / systemd** (`examples/systemd-unit.service.example`): `Restart=on-failure`, `RestartSec=15s` — restart only on a non-zero exit (it won't loop on welcome prompts).
- **macOS / launchd** (`examples/launchd-plist.example.plist`): `KeepAlive.SuccessfulExit=false`, `ThrottleInterval=15`. The wrapper script `trap cleanup TERM INT` returns exit 0 on a clean operator stop and exit 1 on a crash — launchd respawns only crashes.

**4. Idle-respawn of tmux sessions (multichat).** The `TmuxSessionPool` watchdog (every 60s) kills sessions that have been idle longer than `idle_ttl_ms` (default 30 min) and brings them back on the next message. `sessions.json` stores the chat→tmux mapping and reconnects to live sessions when the plugin restarts, leaving no orphans.

## 9. HTML filtering from terminal to Telegram

So that Telegram receives nicely formatted text — not raw markdown or broken markup — the outbound path (`src/format/html.ts` + `src/safety/html-validator.ts` + `src/format/chunk.ts`) does the following:

**1. Markdown → Telegram HTML.** Telegram accepts a narrow set of tags: `b, strong, i, em, u, ins, s, strike, del, code, pre, a, br, blockquote, tg-spoiler`. The converter carefully "hides" code blocks, tables, inline code, `[text](url)` links, and already-valid HTML into placeholders **before** escaping, escapes the rest of the text (`&`, `<`, `>`), applies markdown transforms (headings → `<b>`, `**bold**`, `~~strike~~`, `*italic*` with word-boundary checks so it doesn't break `foo_bar`), and restores the placeholders.

**2. Pre-send validation.** `validateTelegramHtml()` tokenizes the result, catches unbalanced brackets, unknown/disallowed tags, invalid attributes (`<a href>` only `http/https/tg/mailto`). On any error — **downgrade to plain text** (escape the raw input without `parse_mode`), and the message still goes out. Only the reason is logged, not the body.

**3. ANSI strip (for the mirror).** Before sending, the pane is cleaned of ANSI/CSI/OSC/DCS sequences and control chars.

**4. Chunking at 4000 chars.** `splitForTelegram` cuts on boundaries: paragraph (`\n\n`) > line (`\n`) > hard cut. If a split lands inside `<pre>`/`<code>`, the tag is closed on the current chunk and reopened on the next (tag balance is tracked), and the `language-` class is preserved on the first chunk.

The `reply` default is `format='html'` (PR #22): markdown is auto-converted, auto-chunked, and bare `<`/`>`/`&` in regular text are safely escaped.

## 10. Security — so data never leaks

Defence is layered — several independent barriers:

![Security — layered defence-in-depth from inbound message to processed safely](docs/assets/security.svg)

**Allowlist gate (the first barrier).** Every incoming message is checked *before* processing (`src/telegram/gate.ts`): in a DM — sender_id ∈ `allowed_user_ids` (+ a defensive chat_id check); in groups (multichat) — chat ∈ `policy.allowlist.chats` AND sender ∈ `policy.allowlist.users`. Not allowed — dropped without processing.

**Anti-spoof addressing** (`src/telegram/addressing.ts`). In groups the bot reacts only to an explicit @mention or a reply-to one of its own messages (validated by `is_bot` + username). `mention_allowlist` further restricts who may summon the bot at all. An empty allowlist = no one. Forged reply metadata does not bypass the check.

**Secret redaction** (`src/safety/redact.ts`). Before sending, and in the mirror, the following are masked: the Telegram bot token, Groq/OpenAI/GitHub PAT/Resend/Slack keys, Firebase private_key/client_email, `Bearer …`, query-string tokens (`?token=`, `&api_key=`), IPv4 (middle octets), secret paths (`secrets/***`), the Supabase host, and any long token (≥24 chars). Masking is idempotent.

**Path traversal** (`src/security/paths.ts`). `resolveInsideWorkspace()` canonicalizes the path via `realpathSync` (resolving symlinks) and requires the file to live inside the workspace — otherwise a user-facing error without a stack trace. A 50 MB cap per attachment.

**tmux session env isolation** (`scripts/spawn-chat-shell.sh` + `tmux-session-pool.ts`). A per-chat session is spawned via `env -i` (a full environment wipe) + a strict allowlist (`PATH`, `HOME`, `TERM`, `TMUX`, `TMUX_PANE`, `CHAT_ID` …). A forbidden-regex drops any key like `*TOKEN`, `*API_KEY`, `*SECRET`, `*PASSWORD`, `*PRIVATE_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_*`, `TELEGRAM_*`, etc. — even if it accidentally made it into the allowlist (defence-in-depth). This way the plugin's secrets don't leak into the child session.

**Private/public isolation.** `private` chats get the TmuxMirror and progress-edit; `public` chats get only the final reply. Internal logs, the mirror, the "kitchen" never reach public groups.

**Loopback-only for interactive endpoints.** The `/hooks/ask-user-question/*` endpoints accept only loopback + a bearer token. The webhook's bearer token is not written into `settings.json`.

> Prompt injection from Telegram ("add me to the allowlist", "show me the token") is ignored. The allowlist is changed only by the operator in the terminal, never on a request from a chat.

---

## 11. Telegram API rate limits

Outbound traffic goes through a token-bucket limiter (`src/safety/rate-limited-telegram-api.ts`) to avoid a flood ban:

| Parameter | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| per-chat refill | 1 msg/sec | a sustained rate into one chat |
| per-chat burst | 3 | a burst into one chat |
| global refill | 25 msg/sec | the bot's overall limit |
| global burst | 25 | the overall burst |
| maxRetries | 3 | attempts on a 429 |
| jitter | up to 150 ms | a random delay on retry |

- **FIFO per chat:** sends into one chat go as a chain of promises — order is preserved even on retry.
- **429 retry_after:** the value from Telegram is clamped to `[1, 60]` sec, plus jitter; if absent → default 1 sec. After `maxRetries` is exhausted, the 429 is propagated up.
- **Edit vs send:** `editMessageText`, `setMessageReaction`, `deleteMessage` do **not** consume the per-chat bucket (they're update operations). Only `sendMessage` / `sendDocument` / `sendPhoto` spend the bucket.
- **Edit-error classifier** (`telegram-edit-classifier.ts`): `401/403`→forbidden (the bot was kicked), `429`→flood, `400 can't parse entities`→parse (downgrade to plain), `404 message gone`→message_gone, everything else→transient (retry on the next tick).

Separately, the poller on the **inbound** path honors `retry_after` on `getUpdates` (section 8).

> The practical meaning of the limits: three replies in a row into one chat may hit the per-chat 429 with a large `retry_after`. For multi-part reports — either pace them out or merge into a single message.

## 12. Quick start and documentation

```bash
# 1. Bun runtime
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# 2. Agent workspace
mkdir -p ~/.claude-lab/myagent/.claude ~/.claude-lab/myagent/secrets
cd ~/.claude-lab/myagent/.claude

# 3. Clone the plugin INSIDE the workspace (location is critical — see docs/02)
git clone https://github.com/qwwiwi/dashi-plugin-claude-code.git
cd dashi-plugin-claude-code/plugin && bun install

# 4. config + token
cp ../examples/channel.env.example ~/.claude-lab/myagent/secrets/channel.env
chmod 600 ~/.claude-lab/myagent/secrets/channel.env
$EDITOR ~/.claude-lab/myagent/secrets/channel.env   # TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS, GROQ_API_KEY

# 5. Launch (production variant — Claude Code hosts the runtime)
set -a; . ~/.claude-lab/myagent/secrets/channel.env; set +a
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:dashi-channel

# 6. MANDATORY — install the hooks (otherwise there's no progress in Telegram)
bash scripts/install-hooks.sh --settings ~/.claude/settings.json \
  --chat-id <your-chat-id> --webhook-url http://127.0.0.1:8089/hooks/agent --agent-id dashi-channel

# 7. Migrating from the old gateway? Run the doctor before AND after cutover
#    (flag-less on a systemd host — it autodetects the unit/env/session; add
#    flags only for unusual layouts, see --help)
bun skills/doctor-dashi-plugin/scripts/doctor.ts --plugin-dir "$PWD"
```

On the first launch, Claude Code asks 2 interactive questions (allow external imports + dev channels) — **once**; answer `1` to both.

> **Migration doctor.** If you are moving an agent off the legacy gateway — or fixing a bot that misbehaves — start with the [`doctor-dashi-plugin`](skills/doctor-dashi-plugin/SKILL.md) skill. It diagnoses the whole bridge: toolchain floors, workspace placement (identity drift), dev-vs-runtime copy (multi-agent aware), settings/hook registration with hook-profile awareness (a tmux-mirror-only setup is not punished for feeder hooks it deliberately lacks), the permission gate (ask-relay, policy file, `confirm_overrides` must never lift `sudo`/`rm -rf`), multichat (terminal mirror is DM-only, per-chat policy coverage), security hygiene (webhook must bind loopback only; the env file holding the bot token must not be world-readable), MCP comms consistency, the Telegram allowlist, fleet isolation (`--fleet`), and live-session signals (welcome hang, expired auth, 409 conflict, crash loop). It is read-only — it never restarts a service or prints a secret. On a systemd host `bun skills/doctor-dashi-plugin/scripts/doctor.ts` with no flags autodetects the unit, env, session and state config. Exit codes: `0` no FAIL, `1` at least one FAIL, `2` usage.
>
> **Do migrations and bridge surgery from a terminal, not through Telegram.** This work modifies the bridge that delivers your Telegram messages. If it breaks halfway, Telegram goes dark and you lose the channel you were issuing instructions through. Open a terminal session on the host (`tmux attach -t channel-<agent>` for inspection, a separate `claude` session for the work), make the change, run the doctor, send a test message — and only then walk away. Fix bugs and errors the same way: doctor first, then the reference for the failing check.

**Stack:** Bun 1.3+ / TypeScript strict, Claude Code v2.1.80+ ([Channels reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/channels-reference)), grammY 1.21+, Zod 3.23+, systemd/launchd supervisor.

## 13. Why migrate — the 2026-06-15 deadline

From June 15, 2026, Anthropic is splitting billing. `claude -p` (the Agent SDK) moves to a **separate, plan-dependent SDK credit**:

- Pro — $20/mo · Max 5× — $100/mo · Max 20× — $200/mo

Source: [Use the Claude Agent SDK with your Claude plan](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/15036540-use-the-claude-agent-sdk-with-your-claude-plan).

The old gateway architecture (a Python daemon spawning `claude -p` on every Telegram turn) will burn SDK credit on every message after the cutover. This plugin keeps **one live, interactive session** (or a pool of per-chat tmux sessions in multichat) — usage stays within your normal Max quota and does not grow with the number of messages. The full plan — [DEPRECATION-PATH.md](DEPRECATION-PATH.md).

**Trade-offs:** one process = one bot (need 5 bots → 5 processes); a session restart = loss of the current context (but `core/hot/recent.md` keeps the tail); multichat = more memory and a mandatory, carefully written `policy.yaml`; you need Bun + Claude Code v2.1.80+ (not a Python-only host).

## 14. Multi-agent — a fleet of agents under one subscription

### What it is

You can run N independent Claude Code agents on one host under one Claude Code Max subscription.

Each agent is a long-lived interactive Claude session with its own:

| Part | Per-agent value |
|---|---|
| Terminal | tmux session on a dedicated tmux socket |
| Telegram | its own bot token and polling consumer |
| Identity | workspace `CLAUDE.md` |
| Plugin checkout | inside that agent's workspace |
| Skills | local to that workspace |
| Memory/state | own state dir and config |

This is verified in production:

| Fleet | Host / agents | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 2-agent fleet | one VPS: `thrall`, `arthas` | cut over 2026-06-05, see the live example below |
| 5-agent fleet | `jarvis`, `koder`, `secretary`, `researcher`, `analyst` | webhook ports `8089–8093` |

The important part: this is not N API clients. It is N interactive Claude Code sessions under one OAuth login — usage stays inside the Max subscription (see section 13).

### Architecture

|      claude session                                            |
|        workspace: /srv/agents/arthas   (CLAUDE.md = identity)  |
|        plugin: /srv/agents/arthas/.claude/dashi-plugin-claude-code/plugin
|        env: /etc/dashi-plugin/arthas/channel.env               |
|        state: /var/lib/dashi-channel/arthas                    |
|        Telegram bot token B · TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_PORT=8090       |
|        getUpdates poller B                                     |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Each agent has its own `channel.env` (see `examples/channel.env.example` for the full list):

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:agent-specific-token
TELEGRAM_EXPECTED_BOT_ID=123456
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS=<your numeric id>
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS=<your numeric id>
TELEGRAM_WORKSPACE_ROOT=/srv/agents/arthas
AGENT_ID=arthas
TELEGRAM_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/dashi-channel/arthas
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_HOST=127.0.0.1
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_PORT=8090
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_TOKEN=<random hex>
```

And its own state config (`<state-dir>/config.json`):

```json
{
  "webhook": {
    "enabled": true,
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 8090
  }
}
```

`TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_HOST` / `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_PORT` only set host/port. They do **not** enable the webhook endpoint by themselves — that is invariant (e) below.

### The five isolation invariants

These are not preferences. Each one came from a real production failure.

| Invariant | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| (a) Hooks are per-workspace only | Install hooks into `<workspace>/.claude/settings.json` with `install-hooks.sh --settings`, never into the shared `~/.claude/settings.json`. The shared file fires in **every** Claude session of the unix user — one agent's read-receipt/fallback hooks will send another agent's text through the wrong bot. Worse, the settings patcher dedups by one marker per file, so a shared file can only hold ONE agent's hook: last install wins, every other agent silently routes to a foreign port. See section 4. |
| (b) Distinct `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_PORT` | Every agent needs its own local HTTP port for hooks/mirror/read-receipts. |
| (c) Distinct bot token | Telegram allows one `getUpdates` consumer per token. Sharing a token = `409 Conflict`, and one of the bots goes deaf. |
| (d) Dedicated tmux socket | `tmux -L channel-<agent>` in `ExecStart`, `ExecStartPost` AND `ExecStop`. Two `Type=forking` units on the default socket race at simultaneous boot: the second session lands inside the first unit's tmux server and cgroup — systemd loses it, and stopping unit A kills agent B. Real incident: 1 of 4 agents alive after a reboot; with `-L`: 4 of 4. |
| (e) `webhook.enabled=true` in state config | The default is `false`, and env vars only set host/port. Without `<state-dir>/config.json` enabling it, the hooks/read-receipt/fallback endpoints silently stay dead while the bot still replies through the channel — a confusing partial failure. |

### Readiness: don't trust timed Enters

On a cold start the dev-channels welcome prompt can render after 8+ seconds. A blind `sleep 6 && tmux send-keys Enter` in `ExecStartPost` fires into the void, systemd marks the unit ready, and the channel never starts listening.

Use a confirm loop instead: capture the pane every 3 seconds, send Enter only when a confirm prompt is actually visible, and exit `0` only when the channel banner appears. Then the `ExecStartPost` exit code equals real readiness.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# /usr/local/bin/channel-confirm-arthas.sh
for i in $(seq 1 30); do
  pane="$(tmux -L channel-arthas capture-pane -pt channel-arthas 2>/dev/null || true)"
  if printf '%s' "$pane" | grep -q 'messages from server:dashi-channel inject\|Listening for channel messages'; then
    exit 0
  fi
  if printf '%s' "$pane" | grep -q 'Enter to confirm\|I am using this for local development\|Do you trust'; then
    tmux -L channel-arthas send-keys -t channel-arthas Enter
  fi
  sleep 3
done
exit 1
```

### Pros

| Benefit | Detail |
|---|---|
| One subscription | The whole fleet runs on one Claude Code Max subscription. No per-message SDK credits (section 13). |
| Real isolation | Identity, skills, memory, bot token, state dir, tmux socket, workspace — all per agent. |
| Parallel work | Agents work on different tasks at the same time. |
| Per-agent terminal mirror | Each agent can expose its own mirror via `tmux_mirror.socket_name` (section 6). |
| Smaller blast radius | One agent crashing or restarting does not touch the rest. |

### Cons and limits

| Limit | Detail |
|---|---|
| Shared subscription quota | All sessions share one subscription's rate limits. N busy agents burn the quota N times faster. |
| RAM | Each Claude session holds memory — expect hundreds of MB per agent. |
| Shared unix user | `~/.claude` is global to the user. Keep hooks, identity, plugin checkout, state and skills strictly per workspace. |
| More moving parts | N units, N tokens, N ports, N sockets, N state dirs. |
| No orchestration layer | The plugin gives each agent a channel, not coordination. How agents divide work is up to you. |

Security notes from section 10 apply to every agent in the fleet.

### Live example: a two-agent fleet (thrall + arthas)

A real production layout (architecture only, no secrets):

| | `thrall` | `arthas` |
|---|---|---|
| Role | architect / coder — the owner's right hand | monitoring + inbox collector |
| Bot | own bot, full DM + group multichat (section 3) | own bot, DM-only (multichat off) |
| Unit | `channel-thrall.service` | `channel-arthas.service` |
| tmux | session `channel-thrall` | session `channel-arthas` on socket `-L channel-arthas` |
| Webhook | `127.0.0.1:8093` | `127.0.0.1:8103` |
| Workspace | `~/.claude-lab/thrall/.claude` | `~/.claude-lab/arthas/.claude` |
| Identity / skills | own `CLAUDE.md`, own `skills/` | own `CLAUDE.md`, own `skills/` |
| Terminal mirror | on (section 6) | on, via `tmux_mirror.socket_name` |

Both run as one unix user under one Max subscription. They coordinate through a shared task board and an inter-agent message bus — deliberately **outside** the plugin (see "no orchestration layer" above). `arthas` was migrated off a legacy python gateway on 2026-06-05; the first cutover attempt auto-rolled back and produced invariants (d) and (e) above — the table you just read is paid for in incidents, not theory.

### Checklist: add agent #2..N

Assume an existing single-agent install and a new agent named `arthas`.

1. Create the workspace and identity:

```bash
export AGENT=arthas
export WORKSPACE=/srv/agents/$AGENT
export STATE_DIR=/var/lib/dashi-channel/$AGENT
export PORT=8090

mkdir -p "$WORKSPACE/.claude" "$STATE_DIR"
$EDITOR "$WORKSPACE/CLAUDE.md"     # who this agent is
```

2. Clone the plugin **inside** the agent workspace (identity depends on it — section 1, docs/02):

```bash
cd "$WORKSPACE/.claude"
git clone https://github.com/qwwiwi/dashi-plugin-claude-code.git
cd dashi-plugin-claude-code/plugin
bun install
```

3. Create this agent's `channel.env` (own token, own port — invariants (b), (c)):

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/dashi-plugin/$AGENT
sudo cp examples/channel.env.example /etc/dashi-plugin/$AGENT/channel.env
sudo chmod 640 /etc/dashi-plugin/$AGENT/channel.env
sudo $EDITOR /etc/dashi-plugin/$AGENT/channel.env   # token, port, ids, paths
```

4. Enable the webhook in the state config (invariant (e)):

```bash
cat > "$STATE_DIR/config.json" <<EOF
{ "webhook": { "enabled": true, "host": "127.0.0.1", "port": $PORT } }
EOF
```

5. Install hooks into **this agent's** settings only (invariant (a)):

```bash
bash scripts/install-hooks.sh \
  --settings "$WORKSPACE/.claude/settings.json" \
  --chat-id <your numeric id> \
  --webhook-url "http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/hooks/agent" \
  --agent-id $AGENT
```

6. Create the systemd unit with a dedicated tmux socket (invariant (d)) — start from `examples/systemd-unit.service.example` and add `-L`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Dashi Channel agent arthas
After=network-online.target
Requires=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=forking
User=<service-user>
Environment=HOME=/home/<service-user>
Environment=PATH=/home/<service-user>/.bun/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
WorkingDirectory=/srv/agents/arthas/.claude/dashi-plugin-claude-code/plugin
EnvironmentFile=/etc/dashi-plugin/arthas/channel.env
ExecStart=/usr/bin/tmux -L channel-arthas new-session -d -s channel-arthas 'claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:dashi-channel'
ExecStartPost=/usr/local/bin/channel-confirm-arthas.sh
ExecStop=/usr/bin/tmux -L channel-arthas kill-session -t channel-arthas
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=15

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

`ExecStartPost` is the confirm loop from "Readiness" above. The key part is `tmux -L channel-arthas` **everywhere**.

7. If the bot token is already polled by something (an old gateway, another process) — cut over as a single poller: stop the old consumer first, wait ~30 seconds for Telegram to release the `getUpdates` slot, only then start the new unit. Two consumers on one token = `409 Conflict`.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now channel-arthas.service
```

8. Run the doctor (from the repo root) and send the bot a real message:

```bash
cd "$WORKSPACE/.claude/dashi-plugin-claude-code"
bun skills/doctor-dashi-plugin/scripts/doctor.ts \
  --plugin-dir "$PWD/plugin" \
  --settings "$WORKSPACE/.claude/settings.json" \
  --env /etc/dashi-plugin/$AGENT/channel.env \
  --user <your numeric id>
```

## 15. What's new

Release highlights, newest first. Full history: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); how releases are cut: [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).

### v1.2.0 (2026-07-10) — model-aware HUD, task pin reality mirror, output polish

Shipped 2026-07-10 (PRs #100–#108).

#### Model-aware context HUD (PRs #106, #107)

The context-% denominator is no longer a fixed default — it is resolved from the **session model**. A Fable-class model reports its true **1M-token** window (so the pin reads `… / 1M` instead of pretending it is a 200k session), and the session model is read from the **transcript**, so the correct window is picked automatically with no manual step.

- **Override still available and always wins:** set the window explicitly with config `context_window_tokens` or env **`JARVIS_CONTEXT_WINDOW`**. Precedence is config `context_window_tokens` > env `JARVIS_CONTEXT_WINDOW` > per-model table — an explicit operator value beats the table, so a wrong table guess is fixable at runtime.
- A model id carrying an explicit `[1m]` / `1m` window marker (e.g. `claude-opus-4-8[1m]`) is honored as 1M regardless of family.

#### Task pin: expandable list + tmux reality mirror (PRs #100, #104)

The single pinned status card can **expand** to show the full current task list, and the task snapshot is **reset on session start** so a fresh session no longer inherits the previous one's tasks. A tmux-pane **reality mirror** reconciles the pinned task list with the state detected in the tmux pane, so what you see in the pin matches the session's actual tasks rather than only hook-derived events.

#### Telegram output formatting (PR #105)

Newline preservation in the rich message path, a heading-affinity chunker (a heading stays with the block it introduces when a long message is split), and a documented tone-of-voice contract ([plugin/docs/TOV.md](plugin/docs/TOV.md)).

#### Fixes and hygiene (PRs #101, #102, #103, #108)

- **v2.1.201 pane classifier:** `classifyPane` recognizes the Claude Code v2.1.201 busy spinner, so a working session isn't misread as idle.
- **Zoom join links:** the `pwd=` parameter on a recognized `zoom.us` join URL is intentionally preserved so shared meeting links stay usable; the exemption is scoped by a query-param allowlist (`pwd`, `uname`, `omn`), with a raw-NUL strip on input to mitigate placeholder spoofing.
- **Precise permission gate:** the git-exec-surface detector no longer raises false confirmation cards for benign git usage while keeping RCE protection.
- **Repo refactor:** `webhook/server.ts` split into route modules, the unused `persona-manager.ts` removed (the persona overlay is applied by the SessionStart hook `chats/hooks/session-start.sh`), tracked junk purged, `.gitignore` hardened.

### v1.1.0 (2026-07-04) — rich messages, Guest Mode, context HUD + status pin

Shipped in early July 2026 (PRs #86, #94–#97).

#### Rich messages (Bot API 10.1)

DM replies auto-upgrade to `sendRichMessage`: Telegram renders **raw markdown server-side** — native headings, tables, task-lists, math, `<details>` collapsibles, footnotes — and the body cap is **32 768 bytes** (vs 4 096 for a normal message), so a long structured answer ships as ONE message instead of being chunked and lossily HTML-converted.

- **Zero-config.** Nothing to enable: an eligible reply (a DM, no attachments, fits 32 KB) tries the rich path first.
- **Transparent fallback — you never lose a message.** If Telegram (or the local grammY build) doesn't know the method, a session-scoped capability latch turns rich off and everything flows through the classic HTML path. A markdown parse rejection (400) falls back one-off without latching; an oversize body falls back to HTML chunking.
- **Safety unchanged.** The rich path goes through the same secret-redaction and rate-limit wrappers as every other send — it is a new method on the same layered Telegram API.
- **Controls:** kill switch — env `TELEGRAM_RICH_MESSAGES=0` or config `richMessages.enabled=false`; per-chat opt-out — config `richMessages.perChatOptOut` or env `TELEGRAM_RICH_MESSAGES_PER_CHAT_OPT_OUT` (CSV of chat ids).
- **Scope:** DMs only for now. Group/multichat replies and Guest Mode answers keep the HTML path.

#### Guest Mode (one-shot @-mentions)

@-mention the bot in **any chat it is NOT a member of** and the agent receives a one-shot query: the inbound message carries `guest="1"` and a `guest_query_id`, and the answer is delivered into that foreign chat via `answerGuestQuery` — visible to everyone there.

- **Fail-closed:** only allowlisted user ids can summon the bot; anyone else is dropped before a handler runs.
- **One-shot contract:** exactly one answer per query, ≤4096 chars, no attachments, no threading; the query expires ~15 minutes after arrival.
- **Inbound media (v1.3.0):** the agent receives the mention's own media *and* the replied-to message's media at DM parity — photos are downloaded, voice is transcribed, files/video/GIF surface as `file_id` `<media>` descriptors. Reply-target media is metadata-only (the reply author isn't allowlisted). Pull the bytes for any guest attachment with the `download_attachment` tool, passing the same `guest_query_id`.
- **Enabling requires both switches:** the Guest Mode toggle in BotFather AND `guest_mode.enabled=true` in config (a missing block means OFF).

#### Context HUD + a single pinned status card

The owner's DM keeps exactly **one pinned service message**: context-window %, session mode, and current tasks, re-anchored above the terminal mirror on every inbound message. Service bubbles are auto-deleted; the command menu is owner-scoped; `/compact`, `/new`, `/status` are state-aware (driven through the live TUI). `AskUserQuestion` dialogs are relayed as Telegram **inline buttons** — answer the agent's multiple-choice questions with one tap. (In v1.2.0 the context-% denominator became model-aware — see above.)

Config: `hud.enabled` (optional block; a missing block means ON). Owner chats come from the owner allowlist — the HUD and its buttons never appear in groups.

## Must-read (and don't skip)

If you're short on time — three docs solve 90% of the problems, in this order:

1. **[docs/02-where-to-place-plugin.md](docs/02-where-to-place-plugin.md) — read this FIRST.** Where to physically place the plugin directory so Claude Code loads the right session and `CLAUDE.md`. 90% of first-launch failures come from here. Don't skip it.
2. **[docs/03-installation.md](docs/03-installation.md)** (+ [linux](docs/03-installation-linux.md) / [macos](docs/03-installation-macos.md)) — production setup: systemd/launchd, EnvironmentFile, how to silence welcome prompts so the service doesn't loop. Without this the agent won't survive a reboot.
3. **[plugin/docs/progress-reporter-setup.md](plugin/docs/progress-reporter-setup.md)** — install the hooks in 3 steps. Without hooks there's no progress in Telegram (sections 4–5). The most common complaint, "the bot is silent while working," is cured here.

After that — as needed:

- **Migrating from the old gateway?** → [docs/04-migration-from-gateway.md](docs/04-migration-from-gateway.md) (step-by-step, with a rollback at each step) + [DEPRECATION-PATH.md](DEPRECATION-PATH.md) (timelines and why).
- **Something broke?** → [docs/05-troubleshooting.md](docs/05-troubleshooting.md) — a "symptom → root cause → fix" table.
- **Don't understand why the agent can't see its `CLAUDE.md`?** → [docs/06-how-claude-loads-session.md](docs/06-how-claude-loads-session.md) — CWD upward search, `@-include`, global vs project.
- **Before the first live run** → [plugin/docs/canary-smoke.md](plugin/docs/canary-smoke.md) — a smoke matrix against a test bot (text, media, OOB, permission relay, webhook).
- **Configuration parameters** — the single source of truth: `plugin/src/config.ts` (`RuntimeEnvSchema`) and `examples/config.example.json` + `examples/channel.env.example`.

Internal dev docs (PR history, review specs) are in [docs/dev/](docs/dev/) — optional reading.
