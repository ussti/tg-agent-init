"""Docs integrity tests for plugin/docs/progress-reporter-setup.md (docs-B2 #8).

The Codex MEDIUM review surfaced an inconsistent log-location story: the
Smoke-test / Troubleshooting section pointed operators at
``<state_dir>/logs/server.log`` while every other doc (Linux journalctl,
macOS launchd `.out.log`/`.err.log`, tmux pane capture, JSONL permissions
audit, dead-letter forensics) used a different sink. The plugin does NOT
write a ``server.log`` file — that path was phantom.

These tests pin the post-fix shape so a future edit cannot silently bring
the phantom path back:

  1. The phantom ``server.log`` reference is gone.
  2. At least one canonical supervisor-log invocation is documented
     (Linux ``journalctl -u channel-`` or macOS
     ``~/Library/Logs/dashi-plugin/`` or ``tmux capture-pane``).
  3. Both the JSONL permission audit (`permissions.jsonl`) AND the
     dead-letter forensics dir (`dead-letter/`) are documented in the
     same file, so operators see the full log topology.
  4. Every relative markdown link in the file resolves to a real path,
     mirroring the guarantee `test_docs_links.RelativeLinksResolveTest`
     enforces for README/DEPRECATION-PATH.
