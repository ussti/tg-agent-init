// Guest-query registry (Guest Mode, Bot API 10.0, 2026-07-04).
//
// A guest_message update carries a one-shot `guest_query_id`: the bot may
// answer it exactly once via answerGuestQuery, and only queries created by
// an ALLOWLISTED caller ever enter this registry (the handler gates before
// registering). The `reply` tool then authorizes a guest answer purely by
// registry membership — it deliberately does NOT consult the chat
// allowlist, because the originating chat is by definition one the bot is
// not a member of.
//
// Entry lifecycle (dual review 2026-07-04, Codex #1/#2 + Fable #1/#7):
//   pending  --claim-->  inflight  --confirm-->  answered (tombstone)
//                          |  ^
//                   release|  |claim refused ('consumed')
//                          v  |
//                        pending
//
// Fail-closed properties:
//   - unknown guest_query_id       → reject (never answered blind)
//   - inflight/answered id         → reject 'consumed' (kept as tombstone
//     until TTL so the error is clear, not cryptic)
//   - expired entry                → reject (Telegram queries go stale; we
//     mirror that with a conservative local TTL)
//   - duplicate register of a known id → NO-OP. Telegram redelivers
//     updates (poller restart, offset replay); re-registering must never
//     resurrect a consumed query into a second answer (Codex #1) nor
//     evict an innocent entry when the map is at cap (Fable #1).
//   - cap eviction never touches an INFLIGHT entry — evicting one would
//     turn a post-failure release() into a no-op and strand the retry
//     (Codex #2). Victim preference: oldest answered tombstone, then
//     oldest pending; if literally everything is inflight, registration
//     is refused (register returns false; caller logs and drops).
//
// In-memory only: a plugin restart drops pending queries. That is
// acceptable — the query would not survive the restart round-trip anyway,
// and persisting one-shot reply capabilities to disk would only widen the
// replay surface.
