"""Claude Code Stop hook for multichat-thrall — bridge transcript → outbox.

Role:
    In headless mode the router captures the SDK ``result`` event and writes
    the agent's final text to the per-chat outbox. In *interactive* (tmux)
    mode there is no ``result`` event — the per-chat ``claude`` session only
    prints to its transcript JSONL, so nothing ever lands in
    ``{MULTICHAT_STATE_DIR}/chats/{CHAT_ID}/outbox/`` and the router has
    nothing to drain to Telegram. This Stop hook is the interactive-mode
    analog of capturing the headless ``result`` event: on every turn-end it
    extracts the latest assistant text from the transcript and writes an
    ``OutboxMessage`` JSON the router already knows how to send.

Extraction algorithm:
    Based on ``readLastAssistantText`` in ``src/memory/transcript-reader.ts``
    — tail-read the trailing ``TAIL_BYTES`` of the transcript and drop the
    first (possibly truncated) line when not starting at byte 0. It then walks
    lines backward to the MOST RECENT assistant message and returns its
    ``{"type": "text", "text": ...}`` blocks joined with newlines.

    Divergence from the memory reader (deliberate): we return the most recent
    assistant text of the CURRENT TURN — i.e. we walk backward across
    tool-use-only assistant messages and tool_result lines, but STOP at the
    last genuine user prompt. This fixes the 2026-05-28 production drop where
    a turn answered with text and then ended on a tool call (Write / gbrain /
    Bash): the old "most recent message must itself be text, else None" rule
    silently discarded the reply the turn had already produced, so group chats
    received nothing. We must NOT cross the user-prompt boundary, because text
    from a PREVIOUS (already-delivered) turn would be a stale resend after a
    tool-only turn, a resume, or a clear. Dedupe (below) is the second guard
    against re-delivering the same turn.

Safety:
    Fail-safe everywhere — every error path exits 0 so the hook never blocks
    or crashes the session. ``chat_id`` is taken strictly from the ``CHAT_ID``
    environment variable, never from the transcript. Nothing is shelled out,
    so transcript content can never be shell-interpolated. Errors are logged
    to stderr only; stdout is kept clean.

Dedupe:
    Stop can fire repeatedly for the same turn. A state file records the last
    delivered ``(session_id, transcript_path, dedupe_token)``; an identical
    triple short-circuits with no write, preventing duplicate Telegram sends.
    ``dedupe_token`` is the assistant transcript line's ``uuid`` when present
    (falling back to the text hash), so two DIFFERENT turns that happen to
    reply with identical text (e.g. "Готово." twice) are NOT suppressed —
    only the same turn re-firing is.
    This assumes Claude Code serialises Stop invocations for a session (it
    does): two truly-concurrent fires could each read the pre-write state and
    both write. The atomic state rename prevents corruption, not that race —
    acceptable since a rare duplicate send beats a lost reply.
