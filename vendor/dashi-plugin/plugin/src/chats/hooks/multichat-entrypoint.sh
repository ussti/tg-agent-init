#!/usr/bin/env bash
# multichat-entrypoint.sh — tmux session entrypoint for per-chat `claude`.
#
# Spawned by TmuxSessionPool.spawnInternal() instead of `claude` directly.
# Responsibilities:
#   1. Start a background inbox-watcher that polls (or inotifywait-watches)
#      ${MULTICHAT_STATE_DIR}/chats/${CHAT_ID}/inbox/ for new *.json files.
#   2. For each committed JSON: parse text + reply_context + media_paths,
#      build a single prompt string, and inject it into the tmux pane as a
#      bracketed paste (`tmux load-buffer` + `paste-buffer -p`) followed by
#      a VERIFIED Enter — see "Submit reliability" below.
#   3. Move processed files to inbox/.processed/ so the watcher does not
#      reprocess on the next pass.
#   4. exec claude in the foreground so the pane runs the interactive REPL
#      while the background watcher feeds it inbound messages.
#
# Submit reliability (FIX 2026-06-05): the original implementation used
# `send-keys -l "$text"` + `sleep 0.05` + `send-keys Enter`. Two failure
# mechanisms were observed in production (first message of a fresh spawn
# sat un-submitted in the composer until a human pressed Enter):
#   a) First-spawn race — the watcher's initial drain fires while the
#      Claude Code TUI is still booting (banner render, MCP loading), so
#      the trailing Enter lands before the input keymap is mounted.
#   b) Paste-burst grouping — the TUI groups a rapid keystroke burst as a
#      paste; an Enter 50ms behind a multi-line literal is swallowed into
#      the group as a soft newline instead of submitting.
# Countermeasures, in order: readiness gate (poll for the composer prompt
# before first injection), bracketed paste for the body (atomic — never
# grouped with later keys), a paste→submit separation pause, and an
# Enter-only verify loop (re-sends ONLY Enter, never the body, so a
# false "not submitted" reading can never duplicate the message).
#
# Fail-safe behaviour:
#   * CHAT_ID or MULTICHAT_STATE_DIR missing -> exit 2 (refuse to start).
#     This prevents a misconfigured spawn from running a stray master
#     claude with no chat isolation.
#   * TMUX_PANE missing (we are not inside tmux) -> watcher self-disables,
#     but claude still launches so the operator can attach and recover.
#   * python3 / json parse failure on a single file -> log to stderr,
#     skip the file (do NOT move to .processed/ — operator can retry).
#   * Submit unconfirmed after all retries -> the file is moved to
#     .processed/ with a `submit-unconfirmed-` prefix (NOT requeued: the
#     body already sits in the composer, so a re-paste would duplicate
#     it; the next inbound message's Enter flushes the stuck composer).
#
# Concurrency note: the watcher runs as a subshell in the background.
# `trap ... EXIT` ensures we tear it down when claude exits so we do not
# leak watchers across tmux restarts.
