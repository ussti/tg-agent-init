description: Diagnose and safely complete a migration from the legacy Telegram gateway to the dashi-plugin-claude-code channel. Use this whenever an agent is moving off the old gateway, when a freshly migrated bot is silent / hangs / answers as "default Claude", when you hit a Telegram 409 conflict, or when planning the cutover. Trigger on phrases like "переезд на плагин", "migrate from gateway", "доктор для переезда", "бот молчит после миграции", "409 conflict", "channel plugin not responding". Run the doctor BEFORE and AFTER cutover — it encodes every mistake we already paid for so a student's agent migrates without repeating them.

# Doctor: migrate from the gateway to the channel plugin

This skill helps an agent move from the **old gateway** (a Python daemon that
spawns a fresh `claude -p` session for every Telegram message) to the **new
channel plugin** (one long-running Claude session per agent), and diagnose what
went wrong if the migrated bot misbehaves.

Why migrate at all: the old gateway hits a permission-dialog hang without a
bypass flag, has no guarantee the final answer is sent, and — past **2026-06-15**
— becomes expensive because per-message `claude -p` spawn moves to a separate
billing pool. The plugin keeps one live session inside the Max subscription.

The doctor is **read-only**. It never restarts a service, never writes config,
never prints a secret. It tells you what is wrong and points at the fix; you (or
the operator) apply it.

## The one rule that prevents the worst outcome

**Never restart your own channel/gateway from inside your own session.** That
kills the only comms link mid-turn, and the supervisor relaunches you into a
loop. Apply config changes without restarting (the old process keeps running old
code), and let an *external* actor do the restart — the operator in their
terminal, or another service. This is non-negotiable; see
`references/03-lessons-learned.md` §3.

## Workflow

### 1. Run the doctor

```bash
# On a systemd host this is usually ALL you need — the doctor finds the
# channel-*.service unit whose WorkingDirectory matches the plugin dir and
# infers --env / --session / the state config from it (autodetect):
bun skills/doctor-dashi-plugin/scripts/doctor.ts --plugin-dir <...>/plugin

# Explicit flags always win over autodetect; pass them when the layout is unusual:
bun skills/doctor-dashi-plugin/scripts/doctor.ts \
  --plugin-dir <workspace>/.claude/dashi-plugin-claude-code/plugin \
  --settings <plugin-dir>/.claude/settings.json \
  --mcp <plugin-dir>/.mcp.json \
  --settings-local <plugin-dir>/.claude/settings.local.json \
  --env <channel.env path> \
  --user <your numeric Telegram id> \
  --session channel-<agent> \
  --no-autodetect                # opt out of systemd unit discovery
```

Every flag is optional — pass what you have. `--json` gives machine-readable
output for an agent to parse. Exit code: `0` = no FAIL, `1` = at least one FAIL,
`2` = usage error. Settings default to `<plugin-dir>/.claude/settings.json`
when it exists (the session-cwd layout Claude Code actually loads hooks from),
falling back to `~/.claude/settings.json`.

**Multi-agent fleet mode** (README section 14): add `--fleet` to discover every
`channel-*.service` unit on the host (helper units without a tmux Exec line are
skipped) and verify the five isolation invariants ACROSS agents — unique
webhook ports, unique bot tokens (sha256 digests, never printed), a dedicated
tmux socket per unit (duplicates incl. two-on-default fail; a single default
socket is a warn), the shared `~/.claude/settings.json` free of channel hooks,
`webhook.enabled=true` in every agent's state config, and each agent's hooks
pointing at its OWN webhook port (the last-install-wins disaster). Use
`--fleet-dir <dir>` for a non-standard unit directory or in tests. Run it
before and after adding agent #2..N.

The doctor checks, in order: toolchain floors (Claude Code ≥ 2.1, Bun ≥ 1.3.9,
tmux), **workspace placement** (the #1 first-run failure — identity drift),
systemd autodetect, dev-vs-runtime copy (multi-agent aware: matches the running
server by CWD across ALL plugin processes on the host), settings selection +
hooks + token leak, the **hook profile** (a tmux-mirror-only setup is NOT
punished for the feeder hooks it deliberately lacks; feeders are demanded only
when the state config enables a hook-driven status/progress surface), the
**permission gate deep checks** (ask-relay registered next to the gate, the
policy file the gate points at exists, `confirm_overrides` does not lift
`sudo`/`rm -rf`, default tier, the unit carries `--permission-mode
bypassPermissions`), **multichat** (per-chat policy parses, terminal mirror is
DM-only — a public chat with `tmux_mirror: true` is a FAIL, every chat dir has
a policy entry, spawn-chat-shell forwards `TMUX_PANE`), **security hygiene**
(the hook webhook must listen on loopback ONLY — a `0.0.0.0` bind is a FAIL;
the channel env file holding the bot token must not be world-readable; the
user-level `~/.claude/settings.json` must be free of channel hooks), **MCP
comms consistency** (the latent silent-channel landmine — now checked against
the plugin-dir `.mcp.json`/`settings.local.json` by default), the Telegram
allowlist, and live-session signals (welcome-prompt hang, expired auth, crash
loop).

### 2. Read the result top-down and fix the first FAIL

Checks are ordered by causality: a failure early on explains failures later, so
**fix the first FAIL, re-run, repeat**. Don't chase a downstream symptom while an
upstream cause is still red. Each FAIL/WARN carries a one-line `fix:` pointer.

### 3. Reach for the right reference

- Planning or running the move? → `references/01-migration-steps.md`
  (pre-flight, ordered steps, the cutover order, rollback, Linux vs macOS).
- A specific symptom (silent bot, 409, reactions-but-no-reply, crash loop)? →
  `references/02-failure-modes.md` (problems 1–10: symptom → root cause → fix).
- Want to avoid the mistakes we already made? → `references/03-lessons-learned.md`
  (dev-vs-runtime copies, comms-config breakage, self-restart loop, token leak,
  fallback-reply, FTS, push-on-assign, and more — each with a detection check).

### 4. Verify after cutover

A green doctor run is necessary, not sufficient — the only proof is a real
message. Send the bot a message and watch for the reaction flow `👀 → ⚙️ → ✅`
and an actual reply. If silent, diagnose **by architecture, not by symptom**
(service status → tmux capture → identity → only then the Telegram queue); the
order matters and is spelled out in `references/02-failure-modes.md` (Problem 4).

## Diagnostic decision tree (quick reference)

```
bot silent after cutover?
├─ service "active" but no reactions at all
│   └─ welcome-prompt hang → attach tmux, press Enter (Problem 1)
├─ reactions (👀) but no text reply
│   └─ OAuth expired → attach tmux, /login (Problem 7)
├─ logs show "409 Conflict"
│   └─ two consumers on one token → stop the channel, wait 45s, re-test;
│      if 409 persists the second consumer is EXTERNAL — hunt it (Problem 3, §4)
├─ answers but as "default Claude"
│   └─ wrong WorkingDirectory → CLAUDE.md unreachable (Problem 2)
├─ pending=0, no reply, no error
│   └─ allowlist drops your id (Problem 5)
└─ service "activating (auto-restart)", exit 0/SUCCESS, tmux gone
    └─ crash loop — run claude by hand with a TTY to see the real error (Problem 9)
```

## Safety boundaries

- Read-only diagnosis only. Restarts and config edits are the operator's to run.
- Never copy a token between hosts, never print a token (the doctor redacts; keep
  it that way if you extend it).
- Telegram user-account access (Telethon/MTProto) is out of scope and must go
  through the telegram-chip skill, never a direct client.
- Production cutover is a deliberate act — confirm with the operator before the
  stop-old / start-new step on a production bot.

## Extending the doctor

The diagnostic is a single standalone file, `scripts/doctor.ts`, with no
plugin-internal imports (so it keeps working even when the plugin checkout is
broken — diagnosing that is one of its jobs). Pure check functions are exported
and unit-tested in `scripts/doctor.test.ts` (`bun test`). Add a new check as a
pure function returning a `Check`, wire it into `gatherChecks`, and add a test.
Keep every probe read-only and run all output through `redact()`.
